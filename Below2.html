  <h1>Gameplay</h1>
  <p>Buckshot Roulette (Also known as ลูกตะกั่วคมๆ from the developer team.) a computer game made by Mike Klubnika.</p>
  <p>The game started with the menu above, after the players press &quot;Play&quot; the game will send the player to the bathroom, after that the player needs to go to balcony above the club to go to The Dealer's office.</p>
  <p>After that The Dealer will appear with the messages &quot;Please sign the waiver&quot;, the player must sign their name.</p>
  <p>Then, after sign the waiver the game instantly start without tutorial.</p>
  <p>The game basically the game is to grab a shotgun type 12-gauge and shoot yourself with a shotgun or shoot The Dealer, if the bullet is real (Live rounds) the player/Dealer will take the damage, if the bullet is fake (Blanks) nobody will take the damage.</p>
  <p>The first round Player and The Dealer start with a 2 charge.</p>
  <p>The second round Player and The Dealer start with a 4 charge, this round is the first round that includes items. </p>
  <p>Lastly, the third round Player and The Dealer start with total of 6 charge. 4 normal charge and 2 last charge (Note: This wasn't an official name.)</p>
  <p>After Player/The Dealer having 2 charges left they will enter Last Chance (Note: This wasn't an official name either.)</p>
  <p>Meaning if they got lives round on them they will instantly die.</p>
  <p>If could beat The Dealer, The Dealer will die and reward you with money around 70K dollars. (The money will be less up to ML. of beer drink, blanks/lives shotted, and cigarettes used.)</p>
